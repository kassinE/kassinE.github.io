once upon a midnight dreary, while i pondered weak and weary
over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore
while i nodded nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping
as of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber
tis some visitor i muttered tapping at my chamber door
	this it is and nothing more

ah distinctly i remember, it was in the bleak december
and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor
eagerly i wished the morrow, vainly i had sought to borrow
from my books surcease of sorrow, sorrow for the lost lenore
for the rare and radient maiden whom the angels named lenore
	nameless here forevermore

and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
thrilled me, filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before
so that now to still the beating of my heart i stood repeating
tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door
some late visitor entreating entrance at my chambeer door 
	merely this and nothing more

presently my soul grew stronger, hesitating then no longer
sir, said i, or madam, truly your forgiveness i implore
for the fact is i was napping, and so gently you came rapping
and so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door
that i scarce was sure i heard you, here i opened wide the door
	darkness there and nothing more


long into that darkness peering, long i stood there, wondering, fearing
doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before
but the darkness gave no token, and stillness was unbroken
and the only word there spoken was the whispered word lenore
this i whispered, and an echo murmured back the word lenore
	only this and nothing more

back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning
soon again i heard a tapping somewhat louder than before
surely, said i, surely that is something at my window lattice
let me see then what thereat is, and this mystery explore
let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore
	tis the wind, and nothing more

open here i flung the shutter, when with many a flirt and flutter
in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore
not the least obeisance made he, not a minute stopped or stayed he
but with mine of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door
perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door
	perched and sat, and nothing more


then this ebony bird beguiling all my sad fancy into smiling
by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore
though thy crest be shorn and shaven, though i said are sure no craven
ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering on the nightly shore
tell me what thy lordly name is on the nights plutonian shore
	quoth the raven: nevermore

much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly
though its answer litlle meaning, little relevancy bore
for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door
bird or beast above the bust upon his chamber door
	with such name as nevermore

but the raven sitting lonely on the placid bust spoky only 
that one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour
nothing further then he uttered, not a feather then he fluttered
still i scarcely more than muttered, other friends have flown before
on the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before
	then the bird said: nevermore

startled at the stillnes broken by reply so aptly spoken
doubtless said i, what it utters is its only stock and store
caught from some unhappy master, whom unmerciful distaster
followed fast and followed faster, till his songs one burden bore
till the dirges of his hopes that melancholy burden bore
	of never, nevermore

but the raven still beguiling all my sad fancy into smiling
straight i wheeled as cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door
then upon the velvet sinking, i betook myself to linking 
fancy onto fancy in thinking what this ominous bird of yore
what this grim, ungainly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore meant
	in croaking: nevermore

this i sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing to the fowl
whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosoms core
this and more i sat divining, with my head at east reclining
on the cushions velvet lining that the lamplight gloated oer
but whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating oer
	she shall press, ah nevermore

then methough the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
swung by seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor
wretch, i cried, thy god hath lent thee, by these angels he has sent the
respite, respite and nepenthe for thy memories of lenore
quaff o quaff this kind nepente and forget this lost lenore
	quoth the raven: nevermore

prophet, said i, thing of evil. Prophet still, if bird or devil
whepther tempter sent or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore
desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted
in this home by horror haunted, tell me truly i implore
is there - is there balm in gilead. tell me, i implore
	quoth the raven: nevermore

propet, said i, thing of evil! prophet still if bird or devil
by that heaven that bends above us, by that god we both adore
tell this soul with sorrow laden if within the distant Aidenn
it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels named Lenore
clasp a rare and rare radient maiden whome the angels named Lenore
	quoth the raven: nevermore:

be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend i shrieked upstarting
get thee back into the tempest and the nights plutonian shore
leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken
leave my loneliness unbroken, quith the bust above my door
take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door
	quoth the raven: nevermore

and the raven never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door
and his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming
and the lamplight over him streaming throws his shadows on the floor
and my soul from out that lies floating on the floor
	shall be lifted - nevermore!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
